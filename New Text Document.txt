Here's the discord writeup:

wsOHM is a wrapped version of sOHM such that:
• When you wrap your sOHM the amount of wsOHM you get is: sOHM / index.
• 50 sOHM at the index of 10 gets you 5 wsOHM.
• Upon unwrapping wsOHM the amount of OHM you get is: wsOHM x index.
• Example: 5 wsOHM with an index of 12, unwraps to 60 sOHM
• Price of 1 wsOHM is always approximately = price of 1 OHM x Current Index
• You can check current index and wsOHM price at https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/dashboard

And - if possible - could you pull the reward rate for the next rebase and give an estimate of how many sohm will be received at the next rebase?

That's a little harder....
But it's still pretty simple.

# of wsohm * index * reward rate (minus) # of wsohm * current index

The reward rate is here:
